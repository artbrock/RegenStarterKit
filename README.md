# Hyperbook Anywhere Starter

This template repository can be used as a starter for developing a [Hyperbook](https://hyperbook.openpatch.org). You just need to fork it and modify the `basePath` in the `hyperbook.json`.

It contains the necessary files for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages and Vercel.

- GitHub Pages: `.github/workflows/pages.yml`
- GitLab Pages: `.gitlab-ci.yml`
- Vercel: `vercel.json`

It also contains files for working in VS Code and VS Codium (`.vscode`) for local development.

If you want a rapid start you can also open this repository in Gitpod.
